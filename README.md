# Fastidiouscity
This app was built as part of my thesis at Politecnico di Milano. Its aim is to automatically analyze online news and/or political speeches in order to categorize them according to a new taxonomy that we're proposing.
In this repository you can find both the client-side of the application, built in HTML+Javascript, and the server-side, built in Python.
The classifier is built on the new BERT technology published by Google in 2018. I'm not sharing the classifiers' weights because of GitHub size limits, but I will be sharing the notebooks that I used to train and deploy the models.
