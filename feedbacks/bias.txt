"The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. Theyâ€™re not going to get that chance now because weâ€™re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because thatâ€™s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, whatâ€™s at stake here is the Presidentâ€™s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Heâ€™s been running on that, he ran on that and heâ€™s been governing on that. Heâ€™s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, Iâ€™m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But sheâ€™s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing thatâ€™s on the court, and if itâ€™s struck down, what happens? Womenâ€™s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. Theyâ€™re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and thereâ€™s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and theyâ€™ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so itâ€™s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February. ",1.00,yes
